For many engineers, the excessive hype has turned the word "AI" into a somewhat agonizing term. Besides the hype, there seems to be a complacency around building good products. I've seen an overwhelming amount of examples, but let's look at the recent few.

See anything strange here? 

# user experience over technology 
Because this hypetrain is going fast, very fast, I guess it only makes sense for builders, PMs and engineers to come up with "AI product features". It gives everyone a feeling of innovation. Pushing the boundaries of technology. 

Let's go back in time to this wonderful [moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeqPrUmVz-o).

The "AI" marketing doesn't just completely miscommuniate any kind of benefit, it makes things worse. I see it everywhere, it works nowhere, I don't want it. 

Though, I think the sceptical sentiment towards AI tools amongst its consumers is starting to grow. Recently I talked with a CTO in the valley who had a dinner with dozens of other CTOs at large companies. They talked about the adoption of the codegen AI for  their dev teams. It turns out, some of the most hyped and funded teams in the space have overpromised and underdelivered. So much so that these CTOs are reluctant to taking any new demo meetings.

Unfortunately, this makes things hard for everyone including the ones who actually care about building good products that have something to do with AI. 

Building great AI products starts from user experience, [engineering over AI](https://martinantos.com/engineering-over-ai/), problem-first and a first-principle thinking.
