From Jobs:
> _"You know we're constantly taking. We don't make most of the food we eat, we don't grow it, anyway. We wear clothes other people make, we speak a language other people developed, we use a mathematics other people evolved and spent their lives building. I mean we're constantly taking things. It's a wonderful ecstatic feeling to create something and put it into the pool of human experience and knowledge."_

Want to have a good time, travel to distant places, buy nice things, use latest tech, right? But someone has to make that shit. If we all worked [bullshit jobs](https://www.strike.coop/bullshit-jobs/) and just consumed, soon there'd be nothing to consume. The things we use surely didn't come from the consumer class.

What have you decided to work on and why? It feels like people who have the choice do not deliberately make the choice.[^1]  It's even more strartling to hear people describing their their jobs as boring but comfortable. Surprisingly this accounts for jobs in STEM fields too.

Then there are people on the opposite side of spectrum who employ value destruction but they don't represent majority and are quite an obvious case unlike the majority.

How much better off would we all be if we left-skewed this distribution towards value creators? What system needs to be in place so people make conscious decisions?

When I first learned about meritocracy I was sold and wondered why it doesn't always work. Nonetheless, it seemed to be the right recepe for a higly productive society. Skill and effort replace politics and priviledge, proposing a clear objective function of agents in any environment (from highschool to private/public institutions) levelling the playing field for everyone.

Why can't governance and private sector work like sports teams? Which are, in my opinion, representative of succesful meritocracy implementation. But perhaps those in power over other people would too vulnerable.

Well, meritocracy isn't much of a silver bullet as it might seem. Its main limitation lies in its very definition - what kind of skill and effort counts? What is productive? Instagram influencers are indeed rewarded for their effort and one could argue for skill too. Are they useful though?

I believe we desperately need meritocracy with a direction. In this case it's the value add for agents involved which also creates a positive dot product for the uninvolved agents / environment.

Developing a new technology instead of improving an ad engine / engagement. Striving to educate than just going through talking points. Producing goods in an honest way before maximizing revenue. Creating real content instead of selfies. Can't forget the easy but valuable cliche - spreading kindness and love. Everyone can do this one right away at no cost.

We're still far away. Value creation might get us closer.
